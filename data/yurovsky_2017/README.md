2. **Abstract.**
Children learn their earliest words through social interaction, but it is unknown how much they rely on social information. Some
theories argue that word learning is fundamentally social from its outset, with even the youngest infants understanding intentions
and using them to infer a social partner’s target of reference. In contrast, other theories argue that early word learning is largely
a perceptual process in which young children map words onto salient objects. One way of unifying these accounts is to model
word learning as weighted cue combination, in which children attend to many potential cues to reference, but only gradually learn
the correct weight to assign each cue. We tested four predictions of this kind of na€ıve cue combination account, using an eye-
tracking paradigm that combines social word teaching and two-alternative forced-choice testing. None of the predictions were
supported. We thus propose an alternative unifying account: children are sensitive to social information early, but their ability to
gather and deploy this information is constrained by domain-general cognitive processes. Developmental changes in children’s
use of social cues emerge not from learning the predictive power of social cues, but from the gradual development of attention,
memory, and speed of information processing.

3. **Original study info.**

expt 1: 269 total kids (122 excluded), novel objects are balanced for salience

test trials 7 seconds long, disamb at 2.75. 
Familiar -- vanilla trials
Novel & Mutual Exclusivity trials: toys from learning trials, and asked to find previously named toy or novel label

Total of four learning trials, eight Familiar, six Novel, and six ME test trials. 

Expt 2: same as 1 but the novel ones are imbalanced for salience
Salient condition = more salient is target; NonSalient = less salient is target
Salient: 117 children (52 exclusions)
NonSalient: 126 children (71 exclusions) 

4. **Importing decisions.**
Looking at number of subjects/expt, it seems this is approximately post exclusion data. 

Design information was transcribed from an experiment run file. This corresponds with the "salient" condition
where modi meant skwish and dax meant balls (names for toys). 
Communication with authors told us that the differences to nonsalient was just in the what the "correct"
response was, images were the same. (modi means balls, dax means skwish)
For "balanced", modi meant spoon and dax meant star (names of toys) and order was otherwise the same. 

Trial order was the same for all children in an experiment. 

We were given preprocessed data already tagged with aoi. In the provided data, disambiguation is 1 second in. 
5. **Importing ambiguity.**
Trial order and left/right presentation of some images is not certain 
because we had to pull from a running order plus memory of differences between experiments.
