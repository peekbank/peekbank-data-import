## Abstract
Adults and children utilize social category informa-tion during incremental language processing. Genderis a particularly salient social category that is oftenmarked both in speakers' voices and the visual world.However, it is unknown whether toddlers exploit gen-der cues to draw connections between language andother aspects of their environment. The current studyinvestigates whether toddlers use gender cues availablein voices and objects during real- time language process-ing. 22- to 24- month-old toddlers (N = 38) were testedin a looking-while-listening paradigm. On each trial,toddlers viewed two highly familiar objects designedto be prototypically masculine and feminine (via colorand patterns) and heard either a male or female speakerlabel the target object. Lexical processing was facilitatedwhen the vocal gender matched the gender of the targetobject. This work demonstrates that toddlers considerboth object-feature information and inferred speakergender (based on speaker' voice) during online languageprocessing

## Original study info
The data are from the eye-tracking portion of the study, collected with a Tobii X2-60 eye tracker using a 60 Hz sampling rate.
Children first completed a five-point calibration and then saw each trial presented on a static slide, accompanied by audio (played over speakers). 
Children sat in their caregiver's lap during the task and caregivers wore darkened glasses.

Each trial began with two famimilar objects appearing for 1500ms, followed by speech by either a male or female speaker labeling one of the objects in a carrier phrase.

Trials were excluded when child was looking at the screen for less than 50% of the time.

The trials included consistent (gender-matched speaker) and inconsistent (gender-mismatched speaker) trial types.

## Importing decisions


## Importing ambiguity
According to paper there were Trial level exclusions, Import code was adjusted to account for these exclusions.

Stimulus images were available on the original study's OSF. These files have been added to OSF and file_path was adjusted in the stimulus table.

Monitor Size was added.
