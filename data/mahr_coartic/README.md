2.  **Abstract.**

Children learn from their environments and their caregivers. To capitalize on learning opportunities, young children have to recognize familiar words efficiently by integrating contextual cues across word boundaries. Previous research has shown that adults can use phonetic cues from anticipatory coarticulation during word recognition. We asked whether 18–24 month-olds (n = 29) used coarticulatory cues on the word ‘‘the” when recognizing the following noun. We performed a looking-while-listening eyetracking experiment to examine word recognition in neutral vs. facilitating coarticulatory conditions. Participants looked to the target image significantly sooner when the determiner contained facilitating coarticulatory cues. These results provide the first evidence that novice wordlearners can take advantage of anticipatory sub-phonemic cues during word recognition

-   Conditions:

    Trials belonged to three conditions: *facilitating*, *neutral* or *filler*. Target words were presented in carrier phrases (e.g., find *the* \_\_\_\_ ). For the facilitating and neutral items, /d/- and /b/-initial words were presented in yoked pairs (e.g. duck-ball and dog-book). It was manipulated wether the determiner "*the*" provided coarticulatory cues for the target word by cross-splicing different tokens of "the"" with the target words.

    In the **facilitating condition**, the determined "*the*" contained corticulatory cues for the subsequent word-onset consisting of bilabial formant transitions for /b/ or /d/ respectively. In the **neutral condition** items, the determiner token came from the phrase "*the hut*". Authors state that the sequence [ǝhǝ] would not provide any coarticulatory cues for /b/ or /d/. **Filler trials** aimed to maintain interest in the task and were also cross-spliced and presented with the neutral determiner token.

-   Vanilla trials:

    (vanillaness decision Jan 2026): All trials are vanilla because presence or absence of facilitory coarticulation sounds "normal" and is 
    within the range that other vanilla trials have (many datasets don't report splicing or not approach).
