2. **Abstract.**
Negation is an important concept in human language, yet little is known about children’s
ability to comprehend negative sentences. In this paper, we explore how 2–5-year-old chil-
dren’s comprehension of negation changes depending on the context in which a negative
sentence occurs. We collected eye-tracking data while children watched a video in which
they heard positive and negative sentences. Negative sentences, such as ‘‘look at the boy
with no apples,’’ referred to a boy with nothing (Experiment 1) or a boy with an alternative
object (Experiment 2). All children showed greater difficulty in resolving the referent when
negative sentences referred to the boy with nothing, despite suggestions that nonexistence
negations of this type are produced early in development. In addition, 3- and 4-year-old
children showed an initial tendency to look away from the target and towards the named
noun when the referent of the negative utterance was an alternative object. We argue that
the processing of negation in young children is influenced by the cognitive demands of the
pragmatic context in which the negative utterance occurs.

3. **Original study info.**

Experiment 1:  This left a total of 79 children whose data was analyzed; 24 two-year-olds, 31 three-year-olds, and
24 four-year-olds. Each child saw 16 trials, 8 in each of positive and negative condition. During the test phase, 
the images on screen were a boy/girl with nothing and a boy/girl with the named objects. 
The phrase was "look at the boy who has [no] apples". (or other object)

Experiment 2: This procedure left a total of 77 participants whose data was analyzed; 24 two-year-olds, 28 three-
year-olds, and 25 four-year-olds. Each child saw 16 trials, 8 in each of positive and negative condition. 
The images on the screen were a boy/girl with some other objects and a boy/girl with the named objects.
The phrase was "look at the boy who has [no] apples". (or other object)


4. **Importing decisions.**

Data from children who were excluded has not been imported 
(although at least some of it is in raw datafiles). 

Importing decision to only import the positive trials from experiment 2. This includes targets of 
"the boy who has apples" when the target is a boy with apples and the distractor is a boy with pears. 
(Raw data includes all types from experiments 1 and 2, so other conditions could be imported in the future.)

Following paper, point of disambiguation in all materials is on start of noun. (ex: in the boy who has [no] *a*pples, pod is start of apples. )

The AOI region sets has a note that (for l_x_min and r_x_min = x_max / 2 + 200 according to old code - this is most likely an error". Leaving but flagging. 
5. **Importing ambiguity.**
