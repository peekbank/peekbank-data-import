2. **Abstract.**
Negation is an important concept in human language, yet little is known about children’s
ability to comprehend negative sentences. In this paper, we explore how 2–5-year-old chil-
dren’s comprehension of negation changes depending on the context in which a negative
sentence occurs. We collected eye-tracking data while children watched a video in which
they heard positive and negative sentences. Negative sentences, such as ‘‘look at the boy
with no apples,’’ referred to a boy with nothing (Experiment 1) or a boy with an alternative
object (Experiment 2). All children showed greater difficulty in resolving the referent when
negative sentences referred to the boy with nothing, despite suggestions that nonexistence
negations of this type are produced early in development. In addition, 3- and 4-year-old
children showed an initial tendency to look away from the target and towards the named
noun when the referent of the negative utterance was an alternative object. We argue that
the processing of negation in young children is influenced by the cognitive demands of the
pragmatic context in which the negative utterance occurs.
