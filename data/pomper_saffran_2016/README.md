2. **Abstract.**

Language is used toidentify objects in many different ways. An apple can be identified using its name, color, and other attributes. Skilled language comprehension requires listeners to flexibly shift between different dimensions. We asked whether this shifting would be difficult for 3-year-olds, who have relatively immature executive function skills and struggle to switch between dimensions in card sorting tasks. In the current experiment, children first heard a series of sentences identifying objects using a single dimension (either names or colors). In the second half of the experiment, the labeling dimension was switched. Children were significantly less accurate in fixating the correct object following the dimensional switch. This disruption, however, was temporary; recognition accuracy recovered with increased exposure to the new labeling dimension. These findings provide the first evidence that children’s difficulty in shifting between dimensions impacts their ability to comprehend speech. This limitation may affect children’s ability to form rich, multi-dimensional representations when learning new words.


3. **Original study info.**

The final sample included fifty-six full-term children (25 female) with a mean age of 3 years
and 8 months (range = 3;5 to 3;11). 

Children then heard speech identifying one of the objects using either the name 
of the object (e.g., ‘Find the sock’) or its color (e.g., ‘Find the blue one’).
The pictures remained on screen for 1 second after the offset of the sound. 

32 familiar objects (4 in each of the 8 colors) were used in yoked pairs.

original data had columns from -990ms to 6867msm, centered at disambiguation per trial

trials with "Find the sock" are vanilla, trials with color words are not.
