## Abstract
Mobile, touch-screen devices are increasingly ubiquitous in children’s lives. The extensive use of such devices presents an exciting opportunity for data collection. We describe a simple method for creating cross-platform, interactive tablet experiments using open Web-based resources. We illustrate this method by collecting data from 1- to 4-year-old children in a word-recognition paradigm, using 3 different techniques: tablets, eye tracking, and an in-person storybook paradigm. Both accuracy and reaction-time data from the tablet compared favorably with the other methods. Tablets should be considered as a viable method for collecting low-cost, well-controlled developmental data.

## Original study info
The data are from the eye-tracking portion of the study, collected using a SMI RED 120Hz system. 
Children first completed a simple two-point calibration and then saw each trial presented on a static slide, accompanied by audio (played over speakers). 
Children were seated in a car seat mounted in an adjustable-height barber chair.

Exclusion reasons included (a) insufficient exposure to English ("lang") and (b) parental interference ("interference").

The trials included (a) familiar-word trials (two familiar objects), (b) mutual exclusivity control trials (familiar target, novel distractor), and (c) mutual exclusivity inference trials (novel target, familiar distractor).

## Importing decisions


## Importing ambiguity
Some participants were not recorded in the demographics.
As a result, these participants had NAs for exclusion; these were replaced with 0s (i.e., not excluded).
