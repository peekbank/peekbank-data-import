2. **Abstract.**

To explore how online speech processing efficiency relates to vocabulary growth in the 2nd year, the authors longitudinally observed 59 English-learning children at 15, 18, 21, and 25 months as they looked at pictures while listening to speech naming one of the pictures. The time course of eye movements in response to speech revealed significant increases in the efficiency of comprehension over this period. Further, speed and accuracy in spoken word recognition at 25 months were correlated with measures of lexical and grammatical development from 12 to 25 months. Analyses of growth curves showed that children who were faster and more accurate in online comprehension at 25 months were those who showed faster and more accelerated growth in expressive vocabulary across the 2nd year.

TODO

Relevant excerpt regarding stimulus novelty / trial vanillaness:

The speech stimuli at all ages consisted of prerecorded sentences containing target words in
a familiar carrier phrase such as “Where’s the [target]? Do you see it?” At 15 months, the
four target words (doggie, baby, ball, shoe) used by Fernald et al. (1998) were each
presented six times. In addition to these 24 trials, 6 filler trials were included to increase the
variability of the stimulus set. At 18 months, the target words were doggie, baby, ball, and
car, each presented twice as whole words and twice as truncated words (daw, bei, baw, ka).
This manipulation was motivated by the finding that the ability to recognize familiar words
using partial phonetic information develops between 18 and 21 months of age and is related
to level of lexical development (Fernald et al., 2001). In addition to these 16 trials, 13 filler
trials were included.2 At 21 months, doggie, baby, birdie, and kitty, were presented both as
whole words and as truncated words (daw, bei, ber, ki) for a total of 16 trials. On 8
additional trials, the 21-month-olds also heard juice and cookie as target words, preceded by
frames in which the verb was either semantically related (drink, eat) or semantically neutral
(take, look at), with four filler trials. At 25 months, the standard set of target words (doggie,
baby, ball, car) was augmented by target words typically learned later in the 2nd year
(monkey, cow, flower, tree, animal), presented as whole words. To diversify the sentence
frames, we included adjectives (nice, pretty) before target words on 8 trials. Four filler trials
were included.


4. **Importing decisions.**

- word_onset column was set as F0 (i.e. the word onset column in the canonical icoder format)
- no pre-word onset coded data seems to be available
