TODO: create actual README

Include:
The data in this dataset is unbalanced towards the target side, since the targets were almost always more salient/familiar than the distractors.
The trials themselves are fine and usable in the context of the greater peekbank, but looking at the data on a dataset level might be initially confusing due to this imbalance.

Fixed issues:
subject 55 is missing CDI data
subject 5 has duplicate (exactly the same) CDI data
