2. Abstract
Using online measures of familiar word recognition in the looking-while-listening procedure, this prospective longitudinal study revealed robust links between processing efficiency and vocabulary growth from 18 to 30 months in children classified as typically developing (n = 46) and as “late talkers” (n = 36) at 18 months. Those late talkers who were more efficient in word recognition at 18 months were also more likely to “bloom,” showing more accelerated vocabulary growth over the following year, compared with late talkers less efficient in early speech processing. Such findings support the emerging view that early differences in processing efficiency evident in infancy have cascading consequences for later learning and may be continuous with individual differences in language proficiency observed in older children and adults.

3. Original study info
"Participants were 82 children (41 female), recruited from families with 15- to 17-month-old infants identified through birth records. ...

Parents were sent a questionnaire asking about demographic information, language use at home, health history, and family history of language disorders. Parents also completed a MB-CDI: Words and Gestures (Fenson et al., 2006). ...

At 18 months, parents completed the MB-CDI: Words and Sentences. Vocabulary size was the number of words reported to be produced on a checklist of 680 words. ...

Infants’ speed and accuracy in recognizing familiar spoken words were assessed at 18 months in the LWL procedure. ... On each trial, children viewed pictures of two familiar objects and listened to speech naming one of the pictures. ... Children were tested in two 5-min sessions ca. 1 week apart. ... Prior to the first session, parents indicated on a questionnaire whether or not their child understood each of the target words.

Stimuli. Speech stimuli for each session consisted of 32 simple sentences ending with a familiar target noun (e.g., “Where’s the doggy?”), recorded by a female native speaker of English.

4. Importing decisions

NOTES: 
the dataset has LWL data longitudinally on 18 / 24 / 30 mo (same kids), there are non-vanilla trials at 24 and 30 (the LWL at 24 and 30 is not reported in the paper)

For the manju and tempo trials, some were exposure where the object was on a background and some were tests where they were not on the background.

IMPORTANT: for related/unrelated prime noun/verb trials, the trials are represented in the raw data TWICE - once centered on the onset of the verb and once centered on the onset of the noun. We only keep the trial representation centered on the onset of the noun.


Decisions on what conditions constitute vanilla trials:

vanilla:
* familiar
* Vanilla
* UnrelPrime-Noun
* UR-primeNoun
* Familiar-Medial

non-vanilla:
* medial
* AdjSize
* Adjective 
* AdjColor
* AdjAbsSize
* AbsSize
* RelPrime-Verb
* Relprime-Verb
* R-primeNoun
* Novel-Test       
* FerretExposure
* FerretImmTest
* FerretTest
* FerretRetention
* FerretVerbComp 
                  

Right now, the Points of Disambiguation for non-vanilla trials have not been fully checked - so the timings of these trials could be inconsistent. TODO, if we ever find a use for these non vanilla trials 

Carrier phrases:
The file manually_compiled_trial_info_2430.csv in the raw data was manually put together by peekbank members based on the data in TL2-30A.txt, TL2-30B.txt, visit B.txt, visitA.txt. The resulting file is used to look up the carrier phrases for 24mo and 30mo.

IMAGES:
Some images were mirrored depending on left/right positioning - image labels L and R are from the participants' perspective.

Every stimulus target label has multiple images associated with it, which differ in multiple dimensions per target label: version (e.g. there are multiple dogs), age (differing versions per age group), side they were shown on, and whether a background was present or not. We treated these the following way in the imports:

* version: we treated different versions as different stimuli (e.g. bird1 != birdy2). Note: some the images only specify versions using numbers, while the datasets sometimes uses letters (A,B) to indicate differing versions. We assume that A == 1 and B == 2 for image linking purposes (e.g. kittyA (data) == kitty1 (image path))

* age: most of the images are the same across ages, however, there are some (e.g. book) that differ between age groups. For consistency, we have decided to keep them as different stimuli for all targets (e.g. baby1_18 != baby1_24; book2_18 != book2_24). Exceptions: Some images were shown to an age group but are missing their specific version in the stimulus images folder. In these cases, we replaced the stimulus image path to make it point to a version of another age (since most images can be assumed to be identical). These are:
  * shoered_24 missing -> we point to shoered_30
  * ballred_24 missing -> we point to ballred_30
  * shoeblue_24 missing -> we point to shoeblue_30
  * ballblue_24 missing -> we point to ballblue_30
  * kitty1_30 and kitty2_30 is missing -> we point to kitty1_24 and kitty2_24
  * birdy1_30 and birdy2_30 is missing -> we point to birdy1_24 and birdy2_24
  
* side: we have decided to only keep the left version of every image, to stay consistent with the majority of peekbank

* background present: This only applies to the novel items. The raw data gives no indication which version was shown, so we include the image path to the version WITHOUT a background. The items "novelA" and "novelB" have two versions each: one with the moon as a background image, and one with a tangled rope as a background image. There is no indication what background was used in the data, so we link the image with the moon background.

5. Importing ambiguity

Point of disambiguation is tricky for verb and adjective trials - should this be the first informative moment (e.g. when an informative verb was mentioned) or at the onset of the noun?

In the raw data, point of disambiguation:
- exposure novel trials: F0 is the onset of the verb
- 24mos: adjective: word onset is the adjective
- 30mos: hard adjective trials: onset of the color/ size
