2. Abstract

Although word learning unfolds over days, weeks, and months,
individual naming events are over in a matter of seconds. To
benefit from a naming event, children must at least hear the la-
bel and see the referent. We tested 1-, 2- , 3-, and 4-year old
children in a naturalistic word learning task with two condi-
tions: one that taxed both speech processing and rapid gaze-
following, and one in which a social cue-to-reference was
available for an extended time. The development of word-
learning in the extended condition paralleled the development
of speech processing, but learning in the brief condition lagged
behind. However, learning from both the brief and extended
cues was predicted by individual differences in speech pro-
cessing and cue-following together. Thus, even through the
4th year, real-time processing of social and linguistic informa-
tion are a critical bottleneck for word learning.


3. Original study info

Children 1-5 years old were tested, a total of 114 children, 39 of whom were excluded. 
The final sample consisted of 18 1-2 year olds, 25 2-3 year olds, 21 3-4
year olds, and 11 children over the age of 4.

Each child did 4 familiar trials and 6 learning trials (3 in brief, 3 in extended) 
interleaved with learning trials (not included here).

It looks like these are the first 10 trials of each admin in the data, but that there are then 
more (different?) novel trials and more filler trials (?). 

4. Importing decisions

Note that some of the import processing code is in functions in import_helpers.R.

There are many more children in the dataset (435) than are reported in the cogsci paper (114 including some who were excluded)

We do not have access to all the child-level info needed to match the exclusions reported in the paper.
