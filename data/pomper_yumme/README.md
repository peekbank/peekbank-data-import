2. **Abstract**

To learn a new word, children must first identify its referent. When shown a novel object and one or more familiar objects, children select the novel object as the referent of the novel word (e.g., Markman & Wachtel, 1988). Word learning, however, extends beyond this success in referent selection. Learning a novel word involves not only linking that word to a referent, but also making connections to other words and referents to form a semantic network. In past research on referent selection, familiar objects were selected predominantly (or exclusively) based on children’s knowledge of their labels, leading to ecclectic sets of familiar objects (e.g., a cat, juicebox, and bus in Pomper & Saffran, under review). In more naturalistic environments, familiar objects co-occur in systematic ways (e.g., food in a kitchen). In the current experiment, we examine whether this systematicity affects novel word learning. Do children associate a novel word with its semantic context? Specifically, if a novel target and label appears together with a familiar food during learning, will children be more likely to associate it with eating? In the task, children learn novel labels in a mutual exclusivity-type design where they see a novel object (that looks edible) with a familiar object. The familiar object is either edible/ a food (e.g., grapes) or not (e.g., a crayon). In the test trials, infants participate in the LWL task where novel objects are paired (one of which appeared w/ something edible and one of which did not). In the key condition, infants hear a sentence that only refers to eating. There are also control trials that provide the explicit label for one of the target objects.
