2. **Abstract.**

Existing standardized assessments of Executive Function and Memory (EF-Mem) for infants and
toddlers tend to be limited in scope, can be burdensome to administer, and/or do not often utilize
modern technology. Here, we describe the development and validation of the novel iPad-based
EF-Mem measures in the NIH Baby Toolbox® for infants and young children 1–42 months old.
English and Spanish versions of gaze-based (Familiarization) and touch-based measures (Mullen
Visual Reception, Visual Delayed Response, Delayed Memory Task) were adapted for iPad
administration. A nationally representative sample of children (N =2515 recruited; N =2448
who completed at least one EF-Mem measure; n = 1993 English, n = 455 Spanish) were
administered the Baby Toolbox EF-Mem measures as part of the full battery of Baby Toolbox
measures. Most caregivers completed the Ages and Stages Questionnaire 3rd edition (ASQ-3), and
separate subsets of children were administered the Bayley Scales for Infant Development 4th
Edition (Bayley-4, n =120 recruited; n =117 that completed both EF-Mem and the Bayley-4) or
were administered the Baby Toolbox battery again 1–14 days later to assess test-retest reliability
(n =220 recruited; n =187 who completed any EF-Mem measure twice). Measure-level scores
showed expected correlations with age for gaze and touch measures. EF-Mem scores showed
expected correlations with the Bayley-4 for both gaze and touch, indicating convergent validity,
and varied meaningfully based on the ASQ-3 classifications. Test-retest reliability for all measures
and empirical reliability of the touch scores were moderate. Automatic coding and scoring, ease
of administration, reliability, and validity of Baby Toolbox EF-Mem make these measures valuable
for developmental assessment.
